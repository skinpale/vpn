This binding mandatory arbitration provision applies to all Claims that you have against KeepSolid, our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensees, predecessors, successors, assigns, and against their respective employees, agents, or assigns, or that we have against you. This binding arbitration also applies to all Claims regarding the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the Agreement, in whole or in part. This Agreement and arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as it may be amended.

The party filing a Claim in arbitration must file its Claim before JAMS or the American Arbitration Association under the rules of such arbitration administrator in effect at the time the Claim is filed. Arbitration hearings shall be held at a place within Bronx County or New York County, New York, and each Party hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in the foregoing forums. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

This binding mandatory arbitration provision shall survive: (i) termination or changes in the Agreement, and the relationship between you and us concerning the Agreement; and (ii) the bankruptcy of any party or any similar proceeding initiated by you or on your behalf. If any portion of this binding mandatory arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions shall nevertheless remain in force.

The parties acknowledge and agree that a breach of a party's obligations with respect to the non-breaching party's intellectual property or other proprietary rights could cause irreparable harm to the non-breaching party for which the non-breaching party would have no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the parties agree that, notwithstanding the agreement of the parties to arbitrate Claims as set forth above, the non-breaching party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to seek to enjoin preliminarily or permanently any breach or threatened breach of the non-breaching party's intellectual property or other proprietary rights.
